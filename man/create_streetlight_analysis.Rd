\item{enable_15min}{logical, whether the Analysis will analyze in 15-minute day parts.}

\item{enable_upsampling}{logical, whether the Analysis will process with upsampling if it meets the necessary thresholds.
This setting only applies to analysis with \code{enable_15min} enabled.}

\item{is_massive_queue}{logical, whether the Analysis will process alongside other high volume Analyses in order to optimize calculation time.}

\item{enable_completion_email}{logical, whether the analysis will send an email upon completion. Default is \code{FALSE}}

One of \code{"miles"} or \code{"km"}. Default is \code{"miles"}}

\item{unit_of_measurment}{character, one of \code{"miles"} or \code{"km"}. Specifies whether distances
